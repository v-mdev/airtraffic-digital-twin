# Air Traffic Digital Twin

This project aims to create digital twins for air traffic, enabling real-time monitoring and advanced predictive analytics using machine learning and AI.

> **Note:** This project is currently under active development. Features and documentation may change frequently.

The project objectives include, but are not limited to, the following:
- **Real-time flight tracking:** Visualize and monitor flights as they happen.
- **Air traffic congestion prediction:** Use LSTM/GRU models to forecast congested airspace.
- **Deviation detection:** Apply autoencoders to identify abnormal flight patterns.
- **Turbulence and climate event prediction:** Combine CNN and LSTM models for weather-related forecasts.
- **Air traffic simulation:** Explore "what-if" scenarios with reinforcement learning.
- **Pollution prediction:** Estimate environmental impact from air traffic.
- **Delay prediction:** Forecast flight delays using data-driven approaches.
